# PowerContribution
Automate GitHub contribution through the use of PowerShell!  
Currently the script will create a random file and add it to the provided repository.  
## Future Plans  
Want to add ability to supply number of times to commit new file, commit to the same file, and provide username and password to run on separate computer.
